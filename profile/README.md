# README

We're just a college coding club. Nothing special.

We meet in ******, write code, break things, fix them. Sometimes we argue about text editors. Mostly we build stuff.

## The Boring Parts

Founded 2026 because someone needed help with a bug and nobody was around. Turns out lots of people had bugs. Now we have a club.

We don't do competitive programming. We don't prepare for interviews. We don't have corporate sponsors telling us what matters.

We just write code that works.

## Philosophy (if you can call it that)

Programs should do one thing. Text streams are universal. Pipes compose. The source code is the documentation. Worse is better - ship it, iterate, don't wait for perfect.

If your tool needs a framework, you're solving the wrong problem. If your code needs comments to be understood, you wrote it wrong. If it takes more than 500 lines, you're not thinking clearly.

Read the source. All of it. From kernel to shell to the programs you use daily. There's no magic, just code someone wrote. You can write it too.

Automate everything. If you're doing it twice, script it. If you're scripting it twice, you're not automating correctly.

## What We Actually Do

Learn by building. No lectures, no slides, no curriculum. You have a problem, you solve it. Stuck? We unstick you. Working? We help you make it better.

Projects are yours. Could be a shell script. Could be an OS. Could be something that makes your life 2% easier every day. That compounds.

We read code together. Real code, from real projects. See how people solve problems. Steal the good ideas. Learn from the bad ones.

We value tools that compose. Simple beats clever. Working beats perfect. Shipping beats planning.

## Getting Started

New? Start here:

- [How to Get Started](./docs/getting-started.md) - You should be here if you are new
- [Essential Tools](./docs/essential-tools.md) - What actually matters
- [Who to Learn From](./docs/people.md) - The real ones
- [What Not to Do](./docs/antipatterns.md) - Save yourself time
- [Reading List](./docs/reading.md) - Papers and books worth reading

Build something, Or just show up. We'll figure it out.

## Requirements

Curiosity. Willingness to be wrong. Ability to use Google. That's it.

Don't need to know how to code. Don't need CS degree. Don't need fancy computer. Just need to want to understand how things work.

We've taught people who started with "what's a terminal" and now they're submitting patches to projects you've heard of. We've learned from people who walked in knowing more than us.

Everyone starts somewhere.

## Meetings

Day in library(might change).

Bring laptop. Bring problem. Bring solution to share. Bring nothing and just watch. Whatever works.

No attendance tracking. No mandatory anything. Show up when it's useful.

## The Fine Print

We follow ESR's principles because they work, not because they're cool. We use Unix because it's still right after 50 years. We write C because it's close to the machine. We script in shell because text streams compose.

This isn't ideology. It's pragmatism.

When frameworks change every six months but grep stays grep, you learn what matters.

## Current Projects

Check our repos. Check our docs. Check what people are building. If something interests you, jump in. If nothing does, start something.


## Anti-FAQ

**Q: What's the best language to learn?**  
A: The one that solves your problem. But learn C first.

**Q: Do I need to use Linux?**  
A: Unix-like environment. Linux, BSD, macOS with real tools, WSL2. Pick one.

**Q: What if I'm not good enough?**  
A: Nobody is. Build anyway.

**Q: How long until I'm good at this?**  
A: Ten years. Start now.

**Q: Can you teach me to hack?**  
A: We're not that kind of club. Read the docs.

## Contact

Show up to meetings. Send email to `ahaliacomputersociety@gmail.com`. Doesn't matter how.

If you've read this far, you're probably overthinking it. Just build something.

*The best programs are written and rewritten and rewritten.*  
*Eventually they're simple enough to understand.*  

*See you around.*
