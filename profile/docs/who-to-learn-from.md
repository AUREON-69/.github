## Who NOT to Follow

Avoid:
- Framework evangelists
- Complexity merchants

- Influencers over builders
- Anyone selling courses on "how to think like X"

## Local

**In your college:**
- People who've built things
- Anyone maintaining their own servers
- Contributors to open source
- Those who read source code
- System administrators

Ask them questions. Learn their workflow.

## Historical Reading

**Papers:**

- Reflections on Trusting Trust (Ken Thompson)
- The UNIX Programming Environment
- A Research UNIX Reader

**Books:**
- The Art of Unix Programming (ESR)
- The C Programming Language (K&R)
- Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment (Stevens)
- The Practice of Programming (Kernighan & Pike)

## How to Learn From Them

**Read their code:**
- Clone their repos
- Understand design decisions
- See how they solve problems

**Read their writing:**
- Blog posts
- Papers
- Comments in code

**Don't cargo cult:**
- Understand why, not just what
- Adapt to your context
- Question everything

## Test

Can you name:
- Three Unix design principles?
- Two people who created fundamental tools you use?
- One paper or book that changed how you think about code?

If not, start reading.

## Remember

Tools change. Principles don't.

Learn from people who understand principles, not just tools.
