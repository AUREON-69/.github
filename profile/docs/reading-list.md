## Papers

**The Unix Time-Sharing System** - Ritchie & Thompson (1974)

How Unix was born. Design decisions explained.

**Reflections on Trusting Trust** - Ken Thompson (1984)

Security, trust, compilers. Mind-bending.

**The Cathedral and the Bazaar** - Eric Raymond

Open source development models.

**Worse is Better** - Richard Gabriel

Why simple, working solutions win.

## Essays

## Man Pages

```bash
man man        # How to read manuals
man bash       # Your shell
man gcc        # Your compiler
man git        # Version control
man ssh        # Remote access
```

Read them. They're documentation written by people who built the tools.

## Technical Deep Dives

grug-brained-dev.com

Complexity is the enemy. Simple words.

**Write Code Every Day** - John Resig

Consistency beats intensity.

**Choose Boring Technology** - Dan McKinley

New tech has hidden costs.

## Blogs Worth Following

**Julia Evans** (jvns.ca)

Systems concepts explained clearly. Zines worth buying.

**Dan Luu** (danluu.com)

Why computers are slow. Deep technical writing.

**Brendan Gregg** (brendangregg.com)

Performance, profiling, systems.

**Drew DeVault** (drewdevault.com)

Unix philosophy, simplicity, open source.

**cat-v.org/harmful**

What's wrong with popular software. Controversial, thought-provoking.

## RFCs

**RFC 791** - Internet Protocol

How IP works.

**RFC 793** - Transmission Control Protocol

How TCP works.

**RFC 2616** - HTTP/1.1

How the web works.

Read the specs. Understand the protocols.

## What NOT to Read

**Avoid:**
- "Learn X in 24 Hours" books
- Framework-specific tutorials (they expire)
- Medium posts that are really ads
- Books about "clean code" before you've written dirty code
- Anything focused on tools over principles

**Later, not now:**
- Design pattern books (write code first)
- Architecture books (build systems first)
- Scaling guides (ship version 1 first)

## How to Read

**For textbooks:**
- Type every example
- Do the exercises
- Build something with concepts

**For papers:**
- Read abstract and conclusion first
- Skim, then deep dive on relevant parts
- Implement key ideas

**For man pages:**
- Start with DESCRIPTION
- Scan OPTIONS
- Read EXAMPLES
- Try commands

**For code:**
- Clone and build it
- Read main() first
- Trace one feature end-to-end
- Change something small

## Reading Plan

**Start:**
- K&R C book (hands on keyboard)
- Unix Programming Environment
- Man pages for daily tools

**Continue:**
- APUE (Stevens) - selected chapters
- ESR's writings
- Key papers from list above

**Later:**
- SICP or equivalent
- Technical blogs
- Source code of tools you use

**Always:**
- One technical book
- Read code regularly
- Follow active blogs

Move at your own pace.

## Test Understanding

After reading, can you:
- Explain core concepts without jargon?
- Build a toy version?
- Find examples in real code?
- Teach it to someone else?

If not, you haven't learned it yet.

## Remember

Reading without building is procrastination.

Build. Get stuck. Read to understand. Build more.

Repeat.
